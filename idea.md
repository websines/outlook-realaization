The idea is to make a outlook plugin.
An agent that runs on outlook calendar to generate a report based on meetings and calendar to egenrate a report based on meetings done for the date range.

- We need:
Who was the organizer, who were the participants, date of meeting, time of meeting, name of organizer company absed on email domain, name of attending company based on email domain, agenda that was mentioned in the meeting invite.

User will just provide a date rangem and agent will create a table with all the details into a doenloadable excel sheet
